# Here's what this does.  This file is the template to create text based on the answers to your questions.
# You can add and remove questions and associated text/answers here.

# Here's the format.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Any line that starts with a # is a comment.  These are for notes to yourself when making the template.
# Questions start with -Q 
# Answers must follow a question and start with -A
# An answer that is open ended, just a blank line for the user to fill in, should end have a -? after the -A
# Template Text follows each answer and starts with -T
# When the user selects that answer, that text will be included in the output.
# Template Text following an open ended question can use -? in the text and it will be replaced with what the user entered for the answer.

# Tabs or spaces can be used to help organize this template.
